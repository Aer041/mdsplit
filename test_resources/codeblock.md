# Heading 1

some test

## Heading 1.1

- a list
- with another entry
- and for good measure a third one

text before heading
# Heading 2 (dense)
and text after heading
## Heading 2.1
## Heading 2.2

# Heading 3 (with codeblocks)

this is the only case where a hash at the beginning of a line must be ignored:
```
# not a heading but a comment within a code block
```

```bash
# comment
touch /tmp/file.txt 
```

~~~
# also within a codeblock and not a heading 
~~~

# Heading 4

#not a heading since the space is missing
